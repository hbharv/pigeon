    <h2>What gear does a Pigeon need?</h2>
    <p>The most important lesson I've learned when adventure traveling, is that there is <em>rarely</em> something you
        need that you can't find where you are. Exceptions include tubeless bicycle tires; however, I don't recommend
        using them for that reason. An accommodating mindset provides more than the well-provisioned traveler. As a
        child participant in Oddysey of the Mind challenges, our unofficial motto was "Duct tape holds the world
        together!" Even a sizable hole can't contend with the world. </p>
